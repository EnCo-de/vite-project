# React + Vite

This `initial` template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two sites are built, deployed and available:

- [Travel journey](https://35ea736e-86be-48bc-89b8-b1668f4f60b3.e1-us-east-azure.choreoapps.dev) uses React components, props to create a static website. The code is in `components_props` section.

- [Chef Claude](https://3d134c5d-4f34-42cf-bb99-066a9b103d4d.e1-us-east-azure.choreoapps.dev) uses `React.useState()`, conditional rendering, form action capabilities of react 19  to handle form data for building a dynamic user interface. The code is in `useState` section.
